# SECURE CHECK #

## 📖 GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT 📖 ##
**💭1. GAME IDEA.💭**
---

* Our game idea consists of two levels through which graphically represent the possible problems when creating a password that is easy to access, and we will also represent through another level the continuous fraudulent messages that we receive (phishing).

* Our project will be developed on a computer screen. There will be a main screen where the character interacts with a computer screen, and from there, the main game interfacce will open (play, volume, list of levels).

---

**2. INTERFACES.**
---

* Our project will have a main where we can play the game, control the volume and access the list of levels.

* Once we start the game, we will have one level or another in which we will have to select passwords or emails (good or bad).

* You will have a final screen when you pass the levels.

* We will have a 'life' interface (on the left, at the minimum, we will have the image of a computer in good condition; on the right, a damaged computer and on the top of that we will have a silhoutte of a person (simulating the person behind the attack)) where a bar will fill up when we make a mistake.

---

**🕹️3. MECHANICS.🕹️**
---

* When running the game, a person will move to a computer and interact with it to enter the game interface.

* Once inside the interface, we can choose from several options, but if we choose the play option, we will be taken to a first level where we will have to choose the correct option or options from a series of words (passwords). This is done with the mouse or the arrow keys.

* Moving on to the second level, we will see a screen where emails arrive and we have to choose wether they are good or bad, moving them ti the left or right using the mouse ir the arrow keys.

**🎵4. ASSETS AND MUSIC.🎵**
---

* For the development of our project, we will use a series of assets, music and sounds, including:

  * The assets with which the map will be developed.
  * The life bar we will use will be similar to this:

 <img width="200" height="200" alt="life bar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5481352-1b31-4454-8a5e-6d1f62c9e982" />

  * The music we will use is called 'Murasato Shota' (Murasato Shota - Spiral and Heartbeat.mp3). The music will play faster as the life bar fills up.
  * When completing a level, we will play a sound every time we make a mistake.
  * We will use a text font.
